# Demo-jQuery-AdminConsole
This is one of my historical project, not in maintain now, just for reference, and demo my experience. It is an administrator console for mobile web site service. End user may create their mobile web site in minutes by set categories, and articles.

This project is built by jQuery + Bootstrap, use RequireJs to manage modules and dependencies, and a simple PHP proxy to resolve cross-domain issue. It consumes a back-end service which exposes RESTful APIs and JSON data.

Note: I updated some codes, so this project cannot run directly.
